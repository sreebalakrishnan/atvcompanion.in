# ATV Companion App — CLAUDE.md

## What this is
A companion app for Vikram Devatha's Astrology 101 class (allthingsvedic.in). Hosted at `atvcompanion.in`. Built by Sree Balakrishnan (gnuyoga@gmail.com).

**Mid-migration ("new flavour"):** moving from a zero-backend static site to an Express + Supabase app — auth, roles, and localStorage→Postgres migration. Phases 0–1 (backend + auth) are done; Phases 2–6 are pending. See "Active work threads".

## Architecture
- **Frontend.** Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS, one file per page. No build step, no framework. CSS tokens inline per page.
- **Backend (`server.js`).** Express 5. Serves the static site and a JSON API under `/api`. Boots fine without env vars — the static site still works; API routes just return errors.
- **Database.** Supabase Postgres via the `pg` Pool (`DATABASE_URL`). Schema in `db/schema.sql`, applied idempotently on every boot.
- **Auth.** Supabase email + password. Browser signs in client-side via `assets/auth.js`; `server.js` verifies the bearer token and resolves a role. See "Auth & roles".
- **No gate.** The old soft passcode gate is gone (`assets/gate.js` is dead code). Access is now role-based, not passcode-based.
- **Nav:** `assets/site-nav.js` — single source of truth. Add pages to the `PAGES` array. Mount with `<div id="siteNavMount"></div>`. Also injects Plausible analytics and the shared script stack: `auth.js` → `storage.js` → `gating.js` → `scaffold.js` (skips any a page already includes explicitly).
- **Pedagogy scaffold** (`assets/scaffold.js`): drop `<div class="atv-video" data-title data-note>` for a captioned video placeholder, or `<div class="atv-reflect" data-key data-prompt>` for a reflect prompt that saves to `atvStore`. The full light scaffold per content page is orientation → video → sourced sections → reflect → next step.
- **Persistence:** currently `localStorage`; migrating to Postgres (Phase 2) via the `apiFetch` wrapper in `auth.js`.
- **Debug panel:** append `?debug=1` to any URL.
- **Deployment:** Vercel (the Express backend needs Node hosting). `vercel.json` routes all requests to `server.js`; `.vercelignore` excludes the KB, `_root/`, and `node_modules`. Env vars are set in Vercel project settings. Local dev: `npm install && npm start` → `http://localhost:8000`. (Was Hostinger static — no longer viable with a backend.)

## Auth & roles
- Three roles in the `profiles` table: **guest** (default — sees the public-safe site), **student** (approved cohort member — sees Vikram's teaching in full), **admin** (manages roles).
- Open signup: anyone can create an email+password account; everyone starts as guest. Admins promote students via `admin.html`.
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var auto-promotes listed emails to admin on first sign-in (bootstraps the first admin).
- Browser API: `window.atvAuth` (`.ready`, `.user`, `.signIn`, `.signOut`, `.apiFetch`, `.onChange`) and `window.atvUser`. Add `<script src="/assets/auth.js"></script>`; optionally `<div id="atvAuthMount"></div>` for the account chip.
- Server: `requireAuth` guards all `/api/*` except `/api/config`; `requireRole('admin')` guards admin routes.
- `auth.js` and `server.js` use modern JS (the ES5 constraint applies only to the legacy per-page scripts).
- **Content gating** (`assets/gating.js`, loaded site-wide by `site-nav.js`): tag blocks `data-audience="cohort"` (students/admins) or `data-audience="public"` (guests). Cohort blocks are hidden by default CSS, revealed only for a confirmed student/admin role — so guests never see "Vikram said…" depth. Soft gate (markup stays in page source); hard gating would serve cohort fragments from the API.

## Design system (CSS tokens — defined in every page's `<style>`)
Tokens map to the official **ATV Brand Guide** (`ATV Brand 20250828.pdf`) named colours.

Fonts loaded via Google Fonts + Fontshare (Switzer). Max page width: `760px` (some pages use `820px`).
**Brand gaps (Phase 6):** headings should use Libre Caslon *Condensed* (brand spec), not Caslon Text + Cormorant fallback; `kaalapurusha.html` still on an old off-brand palette; the official logo/brandmark is unused.

## Journey architecture (Sanchi's spec — May 2026)
```
Path
 └── Track
      └── Journey
           ├── Resting Spots (reflection, journalling)
           ├── Action Spots (rituals, tasks)
           ├── Traveller Meeting Spots (peer sharing)
           └── Backpack (prerequisites)
```
`planets/moon.html` is the **pilot implementation** — the reference file for all future track pages (Sun, Mars, etc.). All planet tracks live under `planets/`. The `journey.html` file is the workbook team's prototype and should remain separate.

## planets/moon.html — localStorage keys
| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `atv-moon-track-v1` | `{ completed: [1,2,...] }` — completed stop numbers |
| `atv-moon-journal-v1` | All journal textarea values, quiz answers, phase journal, keyed by element ID |

## What is NOT in the KB yet (as of May 2026)
- Moon-specific house descriptions (Moon in 1H, Moon in 2H, etc.) — Stop 8 of planets/moon.html uses general house significations + prompts the learner to make the connection
- Buddha and Kalki avatar prompts (missing from reflective-prompts.md)
- Decks beyond 77 (Mars and Mercury are latest extractions)
- Sun, Mars, Mercury track content (not yet structured)

## Active work threads — "new flavour" build
- **Phase 0 (done):** Node/Express scaffold, `db/schema.sql`, Vercel config.
- **Phase 1 (done):** Supabase magic-link auth, roles, `auth.js`, `account.html`, `admin.html`.
- **Phase 2 (next):** localStorage → Postgres migration. `storage.js` shim; `/api/progress`, `/api/journal`, `/api/prefs`, `/api/chart` endpoints; one-time sync prompt.
- **Phase 3:** Content gating — tag "Vikram said…" / cohort blocks `data-audience="cohort"`, public-safe alternatives, `gating.js` role-aware swap.
- **Phase 4:** Light pedagogy scaffold on every content page (orientation → video placeholder → sourced sections → reflect prompt → next step). Tracks keep the full Moon-style 12-stop journey.
- **Phase 5:** Nav & IA re-look — regroup `site-nav.js` (Start · Tracks · Reference · Tools · Meta · Admin), role-aware.
- **Phase 6:** Fresh design pass — logged-in dashboard homepage, consistency review.

### Earlier (pre-migration) threads
- `planets/moon.html` — "The Moon" pilot, the template for all future tracks under `planets/`.
- Additional tracks (Sun, Mars, etc.) following `planets/moon.html` as the reference.

## Code conventions
- CSS tokens defined inline per page (no shared stylesheet — deliberate for zero-build simplicity)
- JS: ES5-compatible (no arrow functions, no `const`/`let` in critical paths, explicit null checks over optional chaining) for broad browser compat
- `site-nav.js` loaded before `</body>`; new pages added to the `PAGES` array in it
- No external JS libraries. No CDN dependencies for functionality (fonts only).

## Important constraints
1. All content must come from the KB (`astrology-101-knowledge-base/`). If in doubt, ask Sree before adding.
2. Source every content block with a citation (deck number, file name).
3. Do not predict, do not make up significations or interpretations not present in the KB.
4. Vikram's pedagogical principle: "Just don't let the computer take away the human." The app scaffolds the learner's own interpretation — it never generates it for them.
